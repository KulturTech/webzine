      <p>There is a particular quality of light that only exists between two and four in the afternoon. Cats know this. They have arranged their entire philosophy of existence around it.</p>

      <p>My cat, Mochi, does not <em>fall</em> asleep. She <em>arrives</em> at sleep — slowly, deliberately, as though sleep is a destination she has been navigating toward all morning. First the slow blink. Then the tuck of paws. Then the long, considered exhale that says: <em>the world will still be here later.</em></p>

      <p>We have forgotten this. Somewhere between the industrial revolution and the notification badge, we decided that rest was something you <em>earned</em> rather than something you simply <em>are</em>.</p>

      <h2>A Brief History of Doing Nothing</h2>

      <p>The Romans had the <em>meridiatio</em>. The Spanish still have the siesta, though capitalism is doing its best to abolish it. The Japanese concept of <em>ma</em> — the meaningful pause, the productive emptiness — has no real equivalent in English, which tells you something about English-speaking culture's relationship with stillness.</p>

      <p>And cats have never needed permission from any of them.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Time spent with cats is never wasted." — Sigmund Freud, who clearly understood something.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The Radical Act</h2>

      <p>What would it mean to take the afternoon nap seriously? Not as laziness, not as compensation for bad sleep, but as a <em>practice</em> — as deliberate and as dignified as any other act of being alive?</p>

      <p>The cat does not apologise for sleeping. She does not schedule her rest between meetings or set a fifteen-minute timer to avoid entering deep sleep. She simply finds the warmest patch of floor, circles once, and commits.</p>

      <p>There is a lesson here, if we're willing to take it.</p>

      <p>Mochi has no further comment. She is already asleep.</p>
