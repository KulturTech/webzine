    <div class="container prose">

      <p>The ballot box is a nineteenth-century technology operating inside a twenty-first-century attention economy. And the attention economy is not neutral.</p>

      <p>Recommendation systems optimise for watch-time, and watch-time correlates with emotional arousal. Outrage, fear, and tribal affirmation are more arousing than nuance. This is not a conspiracy — it is a design consequence.</p>

      <h2>The Participation Asymmetry</h2>

      <p>The deeper problem is not individual radicalisation. It is <em>participation asymmetry</em>. Studies consistently show that high-engagement political content — which algorithms amplify — skews toward mobilising already-engaged partisans rather than reaching persuadable or disengaged voters.</p>

      <p>The people most likely to be influenced by algorithmic curation are often the least likely to vote at all.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Democratic participation was never perfectly distributed. But it was at least theoretically accessible through the same public sphere — the same newspaper, the same broadcast. We no longer share that sphere.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>What Can Be Done</h2>

      <p>Regulation of algorithmic amplification in political contexts is technically feasible but politically difficult — platforms have strong incentives to resist transparency requirements that might reveal how their systems shape discourse.</p>

      <p>More promising in the short term: civic education that teaches people to recognise the architecture of their own information environment. Knowing that your feed is curated — and curated for engagement, not accuracy — is the beginning of using it with some agency.</p>

      <p>The cat in this picture is asleep, unbothered. Perhaps she knows something we don't.</p>
